### Pre-Installation precautions

- Check whether you have all the tools and equipment
- Ensure there are no physical damages to the monitor.
- Take the monitor out of the packaging
- Set up the installation location such as a pole, wall, or mount on a flat surface
- Make sure the installation location can allow at least 270-degree airflow around the monitor inlet.
- Check the battery specification to understand whether the monitor is solar, or mains powered. Bigger battery specifications are normally reserved mainly for solar-powered monitors. It is worthy to note there are no limitations in having a solar-powered monitor powered by mains. This is a chosen design option by the AirQo team to

### Powering the monitor

- Powering the monitor
- Plug the provided power adapter into a socket and power cord into the monitor. If using a plug other than that provided by AirQo, make sure the plug specifications are 5V, 2A
- The monitor should beep twice to indicate power-up and battery charging
- Deeping on the number of beeps, the status of the monitor can be known as summarised in the table below

**Monitor alarms are summarised in the table below**

| Alarms               | Alarm Tones                    | Tone Details  | Duration   |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------- | :------------ | :--------- |
| Power on             | One beep                       | High          | 0.5 second |
| Transmission failure | One beep                       | Low           | 0.5 second |
| Low battery          | Two beeps (repeated 8 seconds) | Low High      | 1 second   |
| Monitor restart      | Three beeps                    | High Low High | 1.5 second |

### Maintenance

To ensure safety of the system, maintenance should never be performed when the
monitor is powered or connected to the power adapter. The AirQo monitor contains
very sensitive sensors that damage when exposed to electro-static discharge and
extra precautions should be observed to protect sensors susceptible to electro-static
discharge.
