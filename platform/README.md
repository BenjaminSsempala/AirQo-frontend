# Platform setup

Yarn is our package manager of choice. If you don't have it installed, follow this [link](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable).

To run the app, ensure you are in the `platform` directory in the `AirQo-frontend` root directory.

a) Install all the needed dependencies

    yarn add

b)  Create the `.env` file and fill it with the needed information. You can find the needed information in the `.env.example` file.

c) After the installation is complete, run `yarn dev` to start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`
